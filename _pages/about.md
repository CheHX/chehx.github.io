<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk) (HKUST). My research interests include computer vision, medical image analysis, and trustworthy artificial intelligence.

Before HKUST, I graduated from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn) (NWPU) with honors, and obtained a bachelor's degree of software engineering from the school of software and microelectronics. 
During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to receive prestigious honors and awards, including the China National Scholarship.
<!-- Honestly, I have chance to work with some great researchers as Prof.Feiping Nie, Prof. Xuelong Li and Prof. Wei Zheng in the field of machine learning. -->

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
